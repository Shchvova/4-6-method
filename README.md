## v60 brew method

Tetsu Kasuya is a Japanese barista who won the 2016 World Brewer’s Cup with this unique drip brew recipe. It is a very clever way to achieve more control over your pour over, allowing you to dictate the acidity, sweetness, and strength of your cup. If you haven’t tried it, it is definitely worth experimenting with.

### 4:6

This recipe is essentially divided into two parts. The first 40% of the water is used to adjust the balance of acidity and sweetness. The remaining 60% of the water dictates the strength. Since the recipe itself involves making adjustments, it’s all about using these guidelines to tailor the coffee to your preferences.

As always for a drip brew, give your filter a rinse first and discard of the water before you begin. It’s also important to allow all of the water to pass through your filter completely for each pour.

Coffee should be ground coarsely for this method.

### 40% | 60%

The initial 40% of your water is divided into two pours. Using more water in the first pour, the acidity will be stronger. Using less water in the first pour, the overall sweetness will be stronger.

The final 60% of the total water will affect the strength of the overall brew. For a stronger coffee, use fewer pours. For a more diluted coffee, use more.

### Tetsu Kasuya’s Winning Brew

In this example, which was Tetsu Kasuya’s winning brew, he used the following:

- Hario V60 Brewer
- 20 grams of fresh coarsely ground coffee (Natural Panama Geisha)
- 300 grams of water, heated to 92 degrees celcius.

### 40%
Tetsu wanted to highlight the sweetness of the coffee, so used less water in the first pour than in the second.

| Step        | Weight    |
|:------------|:----------|
| Pour 1      | 50 grams  |
| Pour 2      | 70 grams  |
| Total Water | 120 grams |

### 60%

| Step        | Weight    |
|:------------|:----------|
| Pour 3      | 60 grams  |
| Pour 4      | 60 grams  |
| Pour 5      | 60 grams  |
| Total Water | 180 grams |

The total amount of water used was 300 grams (120 + 180).
